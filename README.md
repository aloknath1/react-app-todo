Technologies used: 
1. ReactJS: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is declarative and component-based.
2. NextJS: a React-based framework that lets us render data on the server-side. It helps Google crawl the application which results in SEO benefits.
3. Supabase: provides authentication, database, and storage that we are going to use in our application.
4. Chakra UI: is a simple, modular, and accessible component library that will provide us with the building blocks to build the application.
5. Vercel: will host our application. It scales well, all without any configuration, and deployment is instant.
